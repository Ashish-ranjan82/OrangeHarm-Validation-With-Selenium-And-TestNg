# OrangeHRM Login Automation

This project is a Selenium-based automation test suite designed to validate the login functionality of the [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login) web application. The tests are written in Java using the TestNG framework, with the Page Object Model (POM) pattern employed to separate page interactions from test logic, enhancing code maintainability and readability.

## Project Structure

- **PageObjects**: Contains the page classes (`LoginPage` and `DashboardPage`) that represent the UI elements of the OrangeHRM website. These classes include methods to interact with the elements, such as entering usernames, passwords, and clicking the login button.
  
- **Tests**: Includes test cases (`LoginTest`) that validate different login scenarios. The tests cover both valid and invalid login attempts, asserting the presence of error messages or successful navigation to the dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: The project follows the POM design pattern, which improves code reuse and reduces duplication by keeping the page interactions separate from the test logic.
  
- **TestNG Framework**: Utilizes TestNG for test management, allowing for prioritization, grouping, and flexible test execution.
  
- **Assertions**: Includes robust assertions using TestNG’s `Assert` class to verify the results of each test case, ensuring accurate test validations.
  
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: The project can be easily configured to run on different browsers by modifying the WebDriver setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java**: Make sure Java is installed on your machine.
- **Maven**: Ensure Maven is installed for managing dependencies.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: ChromeDriver is used in this project, but other drivers (e.g., GeckoDriver for Firefox) can be configured.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/OrangeHRM-Login-Automation.git
    ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd OrangeHRM-Login-Automation
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

### Running Tests

- **Run all tests**:
    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```

- **Run specific test**:
    Modify the `@Test` annotations in the `LoginTest` class to include or exclude tests as needed.

### Test Scenarios

- **Invalid Login Test**:
  - Inputs invalid credentials (`Admin`, `1234`).
  - Asserts the presence of the "Invalid credentials" error message.
  
- **Valid Login Test**:
  - Inputs valid credentials (`Admin`, `admin123`).
  - Asserts successful login by verifying the page title.

### Customization

- **Changing the browser**:
  - Update the `setup()` method in `LoginTest.java` to initialize a different WebDriver (e.g., `FirefoxDriver`).
  
- **Modifying wait times**:
  - Adjust the `implicitlyWait` duration in the `setup()` method as per the application's load time requirements.

### Additional Notes

- **Thread.sleep**: Used for demonstration purposes to wait before quitting the browser. For production code, consider using WebDriverWait for better control over element visibility.
